                2020 October 29

                Notes:
                In September I wrote and published this library on our
                Cross Compass Github.

                It's an implementation of Google Protocol Buffers for the
                language Purescript.

                What is Google Protocol Buffers (“protobuf”)?

                ### A way to specify a serialization for some structured data

                In this way, protobuf is like YAML, except
                  * non-readable,
                  * must have a schema for the structure.

                Notes:
                The data is byte-wise, compact, and non-human readable.

                The schema is readable.

                So we can use protobuf for storage or transmission.

                ### A way to generate code that can de/serialize protobuf “messages”

                Notes:
                Each programming language needs its own protobuf
                implementation.

                And this is the killer feature of protobuf.

                Every language that implements protobuf is then a member of the
                protobuf “ecosystem”.

                Notes:
                Here is an example from the README of a `.proto` spec file.

                This `Rectangle` would serialize to an 18-byte message.

                Each field has 1 byte for the type and fieldnumber, and eight
                bytes for the double.

                What is a parser?

                “a parser is just a function that consumes less-structured input and produces more-structured output.”

                — Alexis King [*Parse, don’t validate*](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)

                Notes:
                  Everything that comes in over a process boundary is
                  “less-structured” and should be parsed.

                  And can fail.

                  And can choose either one pattern or another.

                  And provides proof of the structure in the type system.

                __purescript-protobuf__ is built on the concept of “monadic parsing”

                * Parsing monads for the implementation
                * Parsing monads for the API

                So what is a parsing monad?

                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                A parsing monad has

                * __state__ (position in the input stream)
                * __choice__ (we can accept either of two patterns here)
                * __failure__ (the input cannot be parsed)

                Notes:
                Parsing monad are a very useful kind of
                monad.

                Any computer program which takes input can benefit from
                parsing monads.

                The whole purescript-protobuf decoding API is expressed as functions in the
                `ParserT` monad.
