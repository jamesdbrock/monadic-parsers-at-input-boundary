# Monadic Parsers at the Input Boundary

This is a presentation for
[PureConf 2022 18 February](https://hasgeek.com/FP-Juspay/pureconf/)
about monadic parsers in general, and the
[__purescript-parsing__](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-parsing)
package in particular.

## Abstract

When reading a byte stream over the process I/O boundary,
the first thing which everyone should do is to parse the
byte stream with a monadic parser.

The talk will discuss

- Processes and input byte streams.
- Monadic parsers. What they are and why they matter.
- The design and use of the
  [__purescript-parsing__](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-parsing)
  library.
- How to use monadic parsers instead of regular expressions with the
  [__purescript-parsing-replace__](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-parsing-replace)
  library.
- When not to use monadic parsers.

This talk is intended for an audience who has some familiarity with monads and
regular expressions. This talk is inspired and informed by the essay
[Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
by Alexis King.


## The Input Boundary

A process running on a computer is isolated from other processes on that
computer, and from the rest of the world. On that process boundary,
the process has input and output.
The process views its inputs and outputs as either discrete events like
signals and mouse clicks, or as byte streams.

The term ‚Äúbyte stream‚Äù includes any string-like thing, like filenames,
web brower form field values, GIFs,
or anything else represented in process memory as an array of bytes.

Sending a byte stream is easy. We write a byte stream and we send it,
there are no surprises.

When a process reads a byte stream, it must somehow turn the information
in the byte stream into a data structure in the process‚Äôs native language.
Reading a byte stream is difficult, because there may be surprises. We
expect the byte stream to have a certain structure, but it may not have that
structure. A large portion of process bugs, crashes, and security vulnerabilities
can be characterized as a process misbehaving when it encounters suprises in
an input byte stream.

It is the act of reading input byte streams that we will focus on
in this talk. We will be talking about Unicode strings, but
everything in this talk will generalize to any kind of byte stream.

In the year 2022, here are some common methods of interpreting an input byte
stream.

1. Write an ad-hoc parser based on string splitting and regular expressions.
   This is how we end up writing a process which misbehaves on suprises.
2. Use a parser generator or parsing library like Google Protocol Buffers
   or JSON.
   This works okay as long as we control the format of the byte stream,
   which is often not true.
   The reason why such a huge amount of network traffic these days is JSON
   is exactly because reading a byte stream is difficult, and good JSON
   parsers exists for every language. People would rather mangle their
   data into JSON than read a byte stream.
3. Monadic parsers.

I will try to convince you that monadic parsers is always the first method you
should reach for when reading a byte stream from over the process input
boundary.

## Monadic parsers

A parsing monad 
A parsing monad is a monad with three features: It knows its position in the
input string. It can choose alternate parsing branches based on the contents
of the input string. And it can fail.

Let's look at an example of matching a pattern with a monadic parser.

Here is the same pattern expressed with a
